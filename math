math.ceil(x)
Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

math.fabs(x)
Return the absolute value of x.

math.floor(x)
Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x.

math.fmod(x, y)
x % y 

math.isclose(a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)
Return True if the values a and b are close to each other and False otherwise.
rel_tol is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference between a and b, relative to the larger absolute value of a or b. For example, to set a tolerance of 5%, pass rel_tol=0.05. The default tolerance is 1e-09, which assures that the two values are the same within about 9 decimal digits. rel_tol must be greater than zero.
abs_tol is the minimum absolute tolerance – useful for comparisons near zero. abs_tol must be at least zero.

math.isinf(x)
Return True if x is a positive or negative infinity, and False otherwise.

math.isnan(x)
Return True if x is a NaN (not a number), and False otherwise.

math.exp(x)
Return e**x.

math.expm1(x)
Return e**x - 1.

math.log(x[, base])
With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e).

math.log2(x)
Return the base-2 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than log(x, 2).

math.log10(x)
Return the base-10 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than log(x, 10).

math.pow(x, y)      #返回 xy（x的y次方） 的值，等同于x**y
Return x raised to the power y. Exceptional cases follow Annex ‘F’ of the C99 standard as far as possible. In particular, pow(1.0, x) and pow(x, 0.0) always return 1.0, even when x is a zero or a NaN. If both x and y are finite, x is negative, and y is not an integer then pow(x, y) is undefined, and raises ValueError.
math.sqrt(x)
Return the square root of x.

math.acos(x)
Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.

math.asin(x)
Return the arc sine of x, in radians.

math.atan(x)
Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.

math.cos(x)
Return the cosine of x radians.

math.sin(x)
Return the sine of x radians.

math.tan(x)
Return the tangent of x radians.
